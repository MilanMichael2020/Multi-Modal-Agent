            " 1) Current AI impact assessment reports often lack grounding in regulations and fail to address the broad real-world uses of AI systems, primarily because they are not systematically designed with both practitioners and compliance experts. To address this, researchers conducted an iterative co-design process with 14 AI practitioners and 6 AI compliance experts, resulting in a new template for impact assessment reports. This template is grounded in the EU AI Act, NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, and ISO 42001. A subsequent user study confirmed the template effectively provides necessary information for assessments and documents the broad impacts of AI systems, with participants recognizing its value for both compliance and guiding AI design.\n",
